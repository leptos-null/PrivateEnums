## MediaPlayerUI (PrivateFramework)

MediaPlayerUI is a private framework on iOS that assists with audio play-back UI. Its bundle identifier is "com.apple.MediaPlayerUI". The framework provides play, pause, skip, rewind, buy, and other music related buttons, and hooks them up appropriately. The iOS 10 music controls on the lockscreen are handled entirely by this framework.
