## IMCore (PrivateFramework)

IMCore is a private framework on iOS that allows iMessage to work seemlessly. Its bundle identifier is "com.apple.imcore". The framework is reponsible for sending and receiving iMessages. This entails encrypting and decrypting messages, uploading and downloading large attachments, and keeping track of what address is iMessage-enabled, and which isn't.

More information about how iMessage works is described in [iOS Security](https://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf) by Apple Inc.
