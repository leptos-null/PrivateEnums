## SpringBoardUI (PrivateFramework)

SpringBoardUI is a private framework on iOS that provides some graphical utilities to SpringBoard. Its bundle identifier is "com.apple.SpringBoardUIFramework". The framework handles most force touch events, springboard custom alerts, and controls lockscreen plugins.

Some of the enums *exposed* by this framework may not be from within this framework. Further research may be done to resolve or move some enums.
