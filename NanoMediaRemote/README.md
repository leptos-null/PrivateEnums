## NanoMediaRemote (PrivateFramework)

NanoMediaRemote is a private framework on iOS that seems to follow its name- small media controller. Its bundle identifier is "com.apple.NanoMediaRemote". The framework is relatively small, and seems to be able to get and set media information. I checked SpringBoard, backboardd, mediaserverd, and now playing applications, and NanoMediaRemote wasn't loaded into any the processes. Additionally, the simulator doesn't appear to have this framework.
